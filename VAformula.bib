Compared with other methods of presentation, it is far easier in an icicle plot to read off which objects belong to which clusters, and which objects join or drop out from a cluster as we move up and down the levels of the hierarchy, though these benefits only appear when enough objects are being clustered. Icicle plots are described, and their benefits are illustrated using a clustering of 48 objects.},

  abstract={A method for visualizing hierarchically structured information is described. The tree-map visualization technique makes 100\% use of the available display space, mapping the full hierarchy onto a rectangular region in a space-filling manner. This efficient use of space allows very large hierarchies to be displayed in their entirety and facilitates the presentation of semantic information. Tree-maps can depict both the structure and content of the hierarchy. However, the approach is best suited to hierarchies in which the content of the leaf nodes and the structure of the hierarchy are of primary importance, and the content information associated with internal nodes is largely derived from their children.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>},

  abstract={Apart from explicit node-link representations, implicit visualizations and especially the Treemap as their frontrunner have acquired a solid position among the available techniques to visualize hierarchies. Their advantage is a highly space-efficient graphical representation that does not require explicit drawing of edges. In this paper, we survey the design space for this class of visualization techniques. We establish the design space along the four axes of dimensionality, edge representation, node representation, and layout by examining existing implicit hierarchy visualization techniques. The survey is completed by casting some light into regions of the design space that have not yet been explored. Our design space is not a mere theoretical construct, but a practically usable tool for rapid visualization development. To that end, we discuss a software implementation of the introduced design space.},

  abstract = {Abstract Medicine prescriptions play an important role in medical treatments. More insight in medicine prescription behavior can lead to more efficient and effective treatments, as well as reflection on prescription behavior for specific physicians, types of medicines, or classes of patients. Most current medical visualization systems show health data only from the perspective of patients, whereas to understand prescription behavior multiple perspectives are relevant. We present a new approach to visualize prescription data from four different perspectives: physician, patient, medicine, and prescription. Information about physicians, patients, and medicines is shown in three tables; relations between selected items in these tables are shown using custom glyphs and histograms. These tables can also be used to define selections of prescriptions which can be compared to each other by showing a variety of metrics. This enables physicians and possibly other stakeholders to perform a wide variety of queries and inspections, while the use of familiar metaphors, such as tables and histograms, enables them to use the system in short time. This was confirmed by an evaluation session with six neurologists from an institute of epileptology. Our system is tailored to medicine prescription data, but we argue that the underlying pattern in the data is ubiquitous, and that hence our approach can be useful for many other cases where A provides B to C.},

We present a new visualization concept that enables users to explore such data and, specifically, to learn about important items and features that are unknown or overlooked, based on the items and features that are already known. The visualization consists of two juxtaposed tables: an IF-Table, showing all items with a selection of features; and an FI-Table, showing all features with a selection of items. This enables the user to limit the number of visible items and features to those needed for the exploration. The interaction is kept simple: each selection of items and features results in a complete overview of similar and relevant items and features.},

  abstract   = {Clinical decision support systems are widely used to assist with medical decision making. However, clinical decision support systems typically require manually curated rules and other data that are difficult to maintain and keep up to date. Recent systems leverage advanced deep learning techniques and electronic health records to provide a more timely and precise result. Many of these techniques have been developed with a common focus on predicting upcoming medical events. However, although the prediction results from these approaches are promising, their value is limited by their lack of interpretability. To address this challenge, we introduce CarePre, an intelligent clinical decision assistance system. The system extends a state-of-the-art deep learning model to predict upcoming diagnosis events for a focal patient based on his or her historical medical records. The system includes an interactive framework together with intuitive visualizations designed to support diagnosis, treatment outcome analysis, and the interpretation of the analysis results. We demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of the CarePre&nbsp;system by reporting results from a quantities evaluation of the prediction algorithm, two case studies, and interviews with senior physicians and pulmonologists.},

  abstract   = {Physicians are confronted with increasingly complex patient histories based on which they must make life-critical treatment decisions. At the same time, clinical researchers are eager to study the growing databases of patient histories to detect unknown patterns, ensure quality control, and discover surprising outcomes. Designers of Electronic Health Record systems (EHRs) have great potential to apply innovative visual methods to support clinical decision-making and research. This work surveys the state-of-the-art of information visualization systems for exploring and querying EHRs, as described in the scientific literature. We examine how systems differ in their features and highlight how these differences are related to their design and the medical scenarios they tackle. The systems are compared on a set of criteria: (1) data types covered, (2) multivariate analysis support, (3) number of patient records used (one or multiple), and (4) user intents addressed. Based on our survey and evidence gained from evaluation studies, we believe that effective information visualization can facilitate analysis of EHRs for patient treatment and clinical research. Thus, we encourage the information visualization community to study the application of their systems in health care. Our monograph is written for both scientific researchers and designers of future user interfaces for EHRs. We hope it will help them understand this vital domain and appreciate the features and virtues of existing systems, so they can create still more advanced systems. We identify potential future research topics in interactive support for data abstraction, in systems for intermittent users, such as patients, and in more detailed evaluations.},

The medical history of a patient represents the past, which needs to be understood by the physician to make the right decisions. The past contains two different kinds of information: measured data (such as blood pressure) and incidents (such as seizures). Planning therapies, on the other hand, requires looking into the future to a certain extent. Visual representations exist for both the past and the future, and they are very useful for getting a better understanding of data or a plan.

  abstract = {Large collections of electronic patient records provide a vast but still underutilised source of information on the real world use of medicines. They are maintained primarily for the purpose of patient administration, but contain a broad range of clinical information highly relevant for data analysis. While they are a standard resource for epidemiological confirmatory studies, their use in the context of exploratory data analysis is still limited. In this paper, we present a framework for open-ended pattern discovery in large patient records repositories. At the core is a graphical statistical approach to summarising and visualising the temporal association between the prescription of a drug and the occurrence of a medical event. The graphical overview contrasts the observed and expected number of occurrences of the medical event in different time periods both before and after the prescription of interest. In order to effectively screen for important temporal relationships, we introduce a new measure of temporal association, which contrasts the observed-to-expected ratio in a time period immediately after the prescription to the observed-to-expected ratio in a control period 2 years earlier. An important feature of both the observed-to-expected graph and the measure of temporal association is a statistical shrinkage towards the null hypothesis of no association, which provides protection against highlighting spurious associations. We demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed pattern discovery methodology by a set of examples from a collection of over two million patient records in the United Kingdom. The identified patterns include temporal relationships between drug prescriptions and medical events suggestive of persistent and transient risks of adverse events, possible beneficial effects of drugs, periodic co-occurrence, and systematic tendencies of patients to switch from one medication to another.},

  abstract   = {Linear dimensionality reduction methods are a cornerstone of analyzing high dimensional data, due to their simple geometric interpretations and typically attractive computational properties. These methods capture many data features of interest, such as covariance, dynamical structure, correlation between data sets, input-output relationships, and margin between data classes. Methods have been developed with a variety of names and motivations in many fields, and perhaps as a result the connections between all these methods have not been highlighted. Here we survey methods from this disparate literature as optimization programs over matrix manifolds. We discuss principal component analysis, factor analysis, linear multidimensional scaling, Fisher's linear discriminant analysis, canonical correlations analysis, maximum autocorrelation factors, slow feature analysis, sufficient dimensionality reduction, undercomplete independent component analysis, linear regression, distance metric learning, and more. This optimization framework gives insight to some rarely discussed shortcomings of well-known methods, such as the suboptimality of certain eigenvector solutions. Modern techniques for optimization over matrix manifolds enable a generic linear dimensionality reduction solver, which accepts as input data and an objective to be optimized, and returns, as output, an optimal low-dimensional projection of the data. This simple optimization framework further allows straightforward generalizations and novel variants of classical methods, which we demonstrate here by creating an orthogonal-projection canonical correlations analysis. More broadly, this survey and generic solver suggest that linear dimensionality reduction can move toward becoming a blackbox, objective-agnostic numerical technology.},

Large volumes of computer-stored clinical data offer the possibility of aiding in the early detection of subtle trends and states, but the presence of irrelevant data can obscure relevant findings and relationships. We present a formal system for representing complex temporal data as events on an abstract entity called a time line. We define five time line operations, SLICE, FILTER, OVERLAY, NEW, and ADD. For each operation, we precisely define the operator's effect on a time line, including exceptions and boundary conditions. In addition to our time line formalism, we describe an interactive environment designed specifically to help humans visualize temporal data. We have developed a database kernel and a graphical user interface that used our time line formalism and operations to support temporal manipulations. Using our formal system and our visualization environment, we describe two issues in the display and manipulation of temporal data: 1.1. the temporal granularity problem, and2.2. the calendar mapping problem.},

  abstract = {The emergence of very large hierarchies that result from the increase in available data raises many problems of visualization and navigation. On data sets of such scale, classical graph drawing methods do not take advantage of certain human cognitive skills such as shape recognition. These cognitive skills could make it easier to remember the global structure of the data. In this paper, we propose a method that is based on the use of nested irregular shapes. We name it GosperMap as we rely on the use of a Gosper Curve to generate these shapes. By employing human perception mechanisms that were developed by handling, for example, cartographic maps, this technique facilitates the visualization and navigation of a hierarchy. An algorithm has been designed to preserve region containment according to the hierarchy and to set the leaves' sizes proportionally to a property, in such a way that the size of nonleaf regions corresponds to the sum of their children's sizes. Moreover, the input ordering of the hierarchy's nodes is preserved, i.e., the areas that represent two consecutive children of a node in the hierarchy are adjacent to one another. This property is especially useful because it guarantees some stability in our algorithm. We illustrate our technique by providing visualization examples of the repartition of tax money in the US over time. Furthermore, we validate the use of the GosperMap in a professional documentation context and show the stability and ease of memorization for this type of map.},

Bubble Treemaps do not require any color or shading, which offers additional design choices. We explore uncertainty visualization as an application of our treemaps using standard error and Monte Carlo-based statistical models. To this end, we discuss how uncertainty propagates within hierarchies.

With a good choice of colormaps, users are able to acquire information in the data more effectively and efficiently. In this survey, we attempt to provide readers with a comprehensive review of colormap generation techniques and provide readers a taxonomy which is helpful for finding appropriate techniques to use for their data and applications. Specifically, we first briefly introduce the basics of color spaces including color appearance models. In the core of our paper, we survey colormap generation techniques, including the latest advances in the field by grouping these techniques into four classes: procedural methods, user-study based methods, rule-based methods, and data-driven methods; we also include a section on methods that are beyond pure data comprehension purposes. We then classify colormapping techniques into a taxonomy for readers to quickly identify the appropriate techniques they might use. Furthermore, a representative set of visualization techniques that explicitly discuss the use of colormaps is reviewed and classified based on the nature of the data in these applications. Our paper is also intended to be a reference of colormap choices for readers when they are faced with similar data and/or tasks.},

abstract = {Abstract Can a single colour model be used for all colorimetric applications? This article intends to answer that question. Colour appearance models have been developed to predict colour appearance under different viewing conditions. They are also capable of evaluating colour differences because of their embedded uniform colour spaces. This article first tests the performance of the CIE 2002 colour appearance model, CIECAM02, in predicting three types of colour discrimination data sets: large- and small-magnitude colour differences under daylight illuminants and small-magnitude colour differences under illuminant A. The results showed that CIECAM02 gave reasonable performance compared with the best available formulae and uniform colour spaces. It was further extended to give accurate predictions to all types of colour discrimination data. The results were very encouraging in that the CIECAM02 extensions performed second best among all the colour models tested and only slightly poorer than the models that were developed to fit a particular data set. One extension derived to fit all types of data can predict well for colour differences having a large range of difference magnitudes. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

abstract = {Objective
To study the morphological basis of the role of Siqi (cold as winter, cool as autumn, warm as spring, hot as summer), Wuwei (five flavors: sweet, pungent, salty, sour, and bitter), and Guijing (meridian tropism) through the use of information integration.
Methods
A 14C-2-deoxy-glucose autoradiography method was adopted to determine the overall impact of treatment with 39 herbs on functions of various tissues and organs. Data was measured at 4 hs after a single dose and following the last treatment of repeated doses for a week. Least-squares estimation was used and fitted for each herb regression effect of organs and tissues after single and repeated treatment. The slope of the regression line represented the cumulative trend of the effect of the herbs (β), and the standard deviation of the slope (Sβ) was compared with those of the untreated animals (t ‘test). All significantly cumulative effect trends were applied with an artificial neural network, which integrated the relationship among Siqi, Wuwei, and Guijing with tissues and organs.
Results
There is a certain relationship among the Siqi, Wuwei, Guijing and the anatomy of organs and tissues, but the different scores indicate that influence of Siqi, Wuwei, Guijing to anatomy of organs and tissues was a nonlinear state.
Conclusion
Results demonstrated that the effects of Siqi, Wuwei, and Guijing have a morphological basis, and each concept was associated with multiple anatomical structures.}

abstract = {Computing and visualizing sets of elements and their relationships is one of the most common tasks one performs when analyzing and organizing large amounts of data. Common representations of sets such as convex or concave geometries can become cluttered and difficult to parse when these sets overlap in multiple or complex ways, e.g., when multiple elements belong to multiple sets. In this paper, we present a design study of a novel set visual representation, LineSets, consisting of a curve connecting all of the set's elements. Our approach to design the visualization differs from traditional methodology used by the InfoVis community. We first explored the potential of the visualization concept by running a controlled experiment comparing our design sketches to results from the state-of-the-art technique. Our results demonstrated that LineSets are advantageous for certain tasks when compared to concave shapes. We discuss an implementation of LineSets based on simple heuristics and present a study demonstrating that our generated curves do as well as human-drawn ones. Finally, we present two applications of our technique in the context of search tasks on a map and community analysis tasks in social networks.},

abstract = {In many applications, data tables contain multi-valued attributes that often store the memberships of the table entities to multiple sets such as which languages a person masters, which skills an applicant documents, or which features a product comes with. With a growing number of entities, the resulting element-set membership matrix becomes very rich of information about how these sets overlap. Many analysis tasks targeted at set-typed data are concerned with these overlaps as salient features of such data. This paper presents Radial Sets, a novel visual technique to analyze set memberships for a large number of elements. Our technique uses frequency-based representations to enable quickly finding and analyzing different kinds of overlaps between the sets, and relating these overlaps to other attributes of the table entities. Furthermore, it enables various interactions to select elements of interest, find out if they are over-represented in specific sets or overlaps, and if they exhibit a different distribution for a specific attribute compared to the rest of the elements. These interactions allow formulating highly-expressive visual queries on the elements in terms of their set memberships and attribute values. As we demonstrate via two usage scenarios, Radial Sets enable revealing and analyzing a multitude of overlapping patterns between large sets, beyond the limits of state-of-the-art techniques.},

Such problems involve analysing and visualizing set relations between multiple sets defined over the same collection of elements. However, visualizing sets is a non-trivial problem due to the large number of possible relations between them. We provide a systematic overview of state-of-the-art techniques for visualizing different kinds of set relations. We classify these techniques into six main categories according to the visual representations they use and the tasks they support. We compare the categories to provide guidance for choosing an appropriate technique for a given problem. Finally, we identify challenges in this area that need further research and propose possible directions to address these challenges.

abstract = {Areas of interest (AOIs) are defined as groups of elements of system architecture diagrams that share some common property. Visualizing AOIs is a useful addition to plain diagrams, such as UML diagrams. Some methods have been proposed to automatically draw AOIs on UML diagrams. However, it is not clear whether actual users perceive the results of such methods to be better or worse as compared to human-drawn AOI, and what needs to be improved. We present here a process of studying and improving the perceived quality of computer-drawn AOI. For this, we conducted a qualitative evaluation that delivered insight in how users perceive the quality of computer-drawn AOIs as compared to hand-drawn diagrams. Following these results, we derived and implemented several improvements to an existing algorithm for computer-drawn AOIs. Next, we designed a distance metric to quantitatively compare different AOI drawings, and used this metric to show that our improved rendering algorithm creates drawings which are closer to (good) human drawings than the original rendering algorithm. We present here the results of the user evaluation, our improved algorithm for drawing AOIs, and the quantitative analysis performed to compare different drawings. The combined user evaluation, algorithmic improvements, and quantitative comparison method support our claim of having improved the perceived quality and understandability of AOI rendered on architecture diagrams.},

We introduce Bubble Sets as a visualization technique for data that has both a primary data relation with a semantically significant spatial organization and a significant set membership relation in which members of the same set are not necessarily adjacent in the primary layout. In order to maintain the spatial rights of the primary data relation, we avoid layout adjustment techniques that improve set cluster continuity and density. Instead, we use a continuous, possibly concave, isocontour to delineate set membership, without disrupting the primary layout. Optimizations minimize cluster overlap and provide for calculation of the isocontours at interactive speeds. Case studies show how this technique can be used to indicate multiple sets on a variety of common visualizations.},

During both work and leisure, we increasingly interact with information spaces that contain multiple facets and relations, such as authors, keywords, and citations of academic publications, or actors and genres of movies. To navigate these interlinked resources today, one typically selects items from facet lists resulting in abrupt changes from one subset of data to another. While filtering is useful to retrieve results matching specific criteria, it can be difficult to see how facets and items relate and to comprehend the effect of filter operations. In contrast, the PivotPaths interface exposes faceted relations as visual paths in arrangements that invite the viewer to `take a stroll' through an information space. PivotPaths supports pivot operations as lightweight interaction techniques that trigger gradual transitions between views. We designed the interface to allow for casual traversal of large collections in an aesthetically pleasing manner that encourages exploration and serendipitous discoveries. This paper shares the findings from our iterative design-and-evaluation process that included semi-structured interviews and a two-week deployment of PivotPaths applied to a large database of academic publications.},

We also show that GMap's visual metaphor can be slightly altered to outperform BubbleSets in group membership assessment.

abstract = {Categorical data dimensions appear in many real-world data sets, but few visualization methods exist that properly deal with them. Parallel Sets are a new method for the visualization and interactive exploration of categorical data that shows data frequencies instead of the individual data points. The method is based on the axis layout of parallel coordinates, with boxes representing the categories and parallelograms between the axes showing the relations between categories. In addition to the visual representation, we designed a rich set of interactions. Parallel Sets allow the user to interactively remap the data to new categorizations and, thus, to consider more data dimensions during exploration and analysis than usually possible. At the same time, a metalevel, semantic representation of the data is built. Common procedures, like building the cross product of two or more dimensions, can be performed automatically, thus complementing the interactive visualization. We demonstrate Parallel Sets by analyzing a large CRM data set, as well as investigating housing data from two US states.},

abstract = {Understanding relationships between sets is an important analysis task that has received widespread attention in the visualization community. The major challenge in this context is the combinatorial explosion of the number of set intersections if the number of sets exceeds a trivial threshold. In this paper we introduce UpSet, a novel visualization technique for the quantitative analysis of sets, their intersections, and aggregates of intersections. UpSet is focused on creating task-driven aggregates, communicating the size and properties of aggregates and intersections, and a duality between the visualization of the elements in a dataset and their set membership. UpSet visualizes set intersections in a matrix layout and introduces aggregates based on groupings and queries. The matrix layout enables the effective representation of associated data, such as the number of elements in the aggregates and intersections, as well as additional summary statistics derived from subset or element attributes. Sorting according to various measures enables a task-driven analysis of relevant intersections and aggregates. The elements represented in the sets and their associated attributes are visualized in a separate view. Queries based on containment in specific intersections, aggregates or driven by attribute filters are propagated between both views. We also introduce several advanced visual encodings and interaction methods to overcome the problems of varying scales and to address scalability. UpSet is web-based and open source. We demonstrate its general utility in multiple use cases from various domains.},

In this study, a textual and six visual representations for three classic problems were compared using a diverse subject pool through crowdsourcing. Visualizations included area-proportional Euler diagrams, glyph representations, and hybrid diagrams combining both. Our study failed to replicate previous findings in that subjects' accuracy was remarkably lower and visualizations exhibited no measurable benefit. A second experiment confirmed that simply adding a visualization to a textual Bayesian problem is of little help, even when the text refers to the visualization, but suggests that visualizations are more effective when the text is given without numerical values.

abstract = {Venn diagrams with three curves are used extensively in various medical and scientific disciplines to visualize relationships between data sets and facilitate data analysis. The area of the regions formed by the overlapping curves is often directly proportional to the cardinality of the depicted set relation or any other related quantitative data. Drawing these diagrams manually is difficult and current automatic drawing methods do not always produce appropriate diagrams. Most methods depict the data sets as circles, as they perceptually pop out as complete distinct objects due to their smoothness and regularity. However, circles cannot draw accurate diagrams for most 3-set data and so the generated diagrams often have misleading region areas. Other methods use polygons to draw accurate diagrams. However, polygons are non-smooth and non-symmetric, so the curves are not easily distinguishable and the diagrams are difficult to comprehend. Ellipses are more flexible than circles and are similarly smooth, but none of the current automatic drawing methods use ellipses. We present eulerAPE as the first method and software that uses ellipses for automatically drawing accurate area-proportional Venn diagrams for 3-set data. We describe the drawing method adopted by eulerAPE and we discuss our evaluation of the effectiveness of eulerAPE and ellipses for drawing random 3-set data. We compare eulerAPE and various other methods that are currently available and we discuss differences between their generated diagrams in terms of accuracy and ease of understanding for real world data.},

We report on experiments which focus on the creation and layout of graph drawings: participants were asked to draw graphs based on adjacency lists, and to lay them out "nicely.” Two interaction methods were used for creating the drawings: a sketch interface which allows for easy, natural hand movements, and a formal point-and-click interface similar to a typical graph editing system. We find, in common with many other studies, that removing edge crossings is the most significant aesthetic, but also discover that aligning nodes and edges to an underlying grid is important. We observe that the aesthetics favored by participants during creation of a graph drawing are often not evident in the final product and that the participants did not make a clear distinction between the processes of creation and layout. Our results suggest that graph drawing systems should integrate automatic layout with the user's manual editing process, and provide facilities to support grid-based graph creation.},

abstract = {Many automatic graph layout algorithms have been designed and implemented to display relational data in a graphical (usually node-arc) manner. The success of these algorithms is typically measured by their computational efficiency and the extent to which they conform to aesthetic criteria (for example, minimising the number of crossings, maximising symmetry). Little research has been performed on the usability aspects of such algorithms: do they produce graph drawings that make the embodied information easy to use and understand? Is the computational effort expended on conforming to the assumed aesthetic criteria justifiable with respect to better usability? This paper reports on usability studies that were performed to investigate the merit of automatic graph layout algorithms with respect to human use. The paper describes three ways in which this issue has been considered experimentally: first, investigating individual aesthetic criteria in simple, abstract graph structures; second, investigating the results of common automatic graph layout algorithms; and third, investigating individual aesthetic criteria and other relevant secondary notations in Unified Modeling Language class and collaboration diagrams. The results show that the use of only some aesthetics affect usability significantly, and that the semantic domain of the graph drawings affects which aesthetic criteria need to be emphasised.},

@article{Riche10,
abstract = {In many common data analysis scenarios the data elements are logically grouped into sets. Venn and Euler style diagrams are a common visual representation of such set membership where the data elements are represented by labels or glyphs and sets are indicated by boundaries surrounding their members. Generating such diagrams automatically such that set regions do not intersect unless the corresponding sets have a non-empty intersection is a difficult problem. Further, it may be impossible in some cases if regions are required to be continuous and convex. Several approaches exist to draw such set regions using more complex shapes, however, the resulting diagrams can be difficult to interpret. In this paper we present two novel approaches for simplifying a complex collection of intersecting sets into a strict hierarchy that can be more easily automatically arranged and drawn (Figure 1). In the first approach, we use compact rectangular shapes for drawing each set, attempting to improve the readability of the set intersections. In the second approach, we avoid drawing intersecting set regions by duplicating elements belonging to multiple sets. We compared both of our techniques to the traditional non-convex region technique using five readability tasks. Our results show that the compact rectangular shapes technique was often preferred by experimental subjects even though the use of duplications dramatically improves the accuracy and performance time for most of our tasks. In addition to general set representation our techniques are also applicable to visualization of networks with intersecting clusters of nodes.},

abstract = {Area-proportional Venn diagrams are a popular way of visualizing the relationships between data sets, where the set intersections have a specified numerical value. In these diagrams, the areas of the regions are in proportion to the given values. Venn-3, the Venn diagram consisting of three intersecting curves, has been used in many applications, including marketing, ecology and medicine. Whilst circles are widely used to draw such diagrams, most area specifications cannot be drawn in this way and, so, should only be used where an approximate solution is acceptable. However, placing different restrictions on the shape of curves may result in usable diagrams that have an exact solution, that is, where the areas of the regions are exactly in proportion to the represented data. In this paper, we explore the use of convex shapes for drawing exact area proportional Venn-3 diagrams. Convex curves reduce the visual complexity of the diagram and, as most desirable shapes (such as circles, ovals and rectangles) are convex, the work described here may lead to further drawing methods with these shapes. We describe methods for constructing convex diagrams with polygons that have four or five sides and derive results concerning which area specifications can be drawn with them. This work improves the state-of-the-art by extending the set of area specifications that can be drawn in a convex manner. We also show how, when a specification cannot be drawn in a convex manner, a non-convex drawing can be generated.},

This permits us to build Euler diagrams inductively, adding one curve at a time. Our technique is adaptable, allowing the easy specification, and enforcement, of sets of well-formedness conditions; we present a series of results that identify properties of cycles that correspond to the well-formedness conditions. This improves upon other contributions toward the automated generation of Euler diagrams which implicitly assume some fixed set of well-formedness conditions must hold. In addition, unlike most of these other generation methods, our technique allows any abstract description to be drawn as an Euler diagram.

abstract = {Euler diagrams are used for visualizing categorized data. These categories, together with information about when categories share some datum, can be turned into a succinct diagram description from which an Euler diagram can be generated. Closed curves represent the categories and the relationships between the curves (such as containment) correspond to relationships between the categories (such as subset). A range of automated Euler diagram drawing methods have been proposed but they often produce diagrams that are aesthetically unpleasing, can be computationally complex and most of them cannot draw a diagram for some (often many) given collections of categories. One such method is capable of drawing aesthetically pleasing Euler diagrams, using only circles, and is computationally efficient (being of polynomial time complexity) but it applies to a very restricted subset of collections of categorized data. This paper substantially extends that method so it can always draw an Euler diagram, that is it applies to all collections of categorized data. In particular, we identify a class of diagram descriptions that can be drawn with circles, generalizing previous work. For diagram descriptions outside of this class, we define transformations that can be used to turn them into descriptions inside the ‘drawable with circles' class. We demonstrate how such transformations can be done in a general, a process during which many choices must be made. Further, we provide strategies for making particular choices which ensure desirable properties, such as curve containment, are preserved. We have provided a software implementation of the drawing method, which is freely available from www.eulerdiagrams.com/inductivecircles.htm.},

abstract = {Evaluating, comparing, and interpreting related pieces of information are tasks that are commonly performed during visual data analysis and in many kinds of information-intensive work. Synchronized visual highlighting of related elements is a well-known technique used to assist this task. An alternative approach, which is more invasive but also more expressive is visual linking in which line connections are rendered between related elements. In this work, we present context-preserving visual links as a new method for generating visual links. The method specifically aims to fulfill the following two goals: first, visual links should minimize the occlusion of important information; second, links should visually stand out from surrounding information by minimizing visual interference. We employ an image-based analysis of visual saliency to determine the important regions in the original representation. A consequence of the image-based approach is that our technique is application-independent and can be employed in a large number of visual data analysis scenarios in which the underlying content cannot or should not be altered. We conducted a controlled experiment that indicates that users can find linked elements in complex visualizations more quickly and with greater subjective satisfaction than in complex visualizations in which plain highlighting is used. Context-preserving visual links were perceived as visually more attractive than traditional visual links that do not account for the context information.},

@article{Vehlow13,
abstract = {An important feature of networks for many application domains is their community structure. This is because objects within the same community usually have at least one property in common. The investigation of community structure can therefore support the understanding of object attributes from the network topology alone. In real-world systems, objects may belong to several communities at the same time, i.e., communities can overlap. Analyzing fuzzy community memberships is essential to understand to what extent objects contribute to different communities and whether some communities are highly interconnected. We developed a visualization approach that is based on node-link diagrams and supports the investigation of fuzzy communities in weighted undirected graphs at different levels of detail. Starting with the network of communities, the user can continuously drill down to the network of individual nodes and finally analyze the membership distribution of nodes of interest. Our approach uses layout strategies and further visual mappings to graphically encode the fuzzy community memberships. The usefulness of our approach is illustrated by two case studies analyzing networks of different domains: social networking and biological interactions. The case studies showed that our layout and visualization approach helps investigate fuzzy overlapping communities. Fuzzy vertices as well as the different communities to which they belong can be easily identified based on node color and position.},

abstract = {In this paper we address the problem of visualizing overlapping sets of points with a fixed positioning in a comprehensible way. A standard visualization technique is to enclose the point sets in isocontours generated by bounding a potential field function. The most commonly used functions are various approximations of the Gaussian distribution. Such an approach produces smooth and appealing shapes, however it may produce an incorrect point nesting in generated regions, e.g. some point is contained inside a foreign set region. We introduce a different potential field function that keeps the desired properties of Gaussian distribution, and in addition guarantees that every point belongs to all its sets' regions and no others, and that regions of two sets with no common points have no overlaps. The presented function works well if the sets intersect each other, a situation that often arises in social network graphs, producing regions that reveal the structure of their clustering.},

@article{Wang20,
abstract = {Many edge bundling techniques (i.e., data simplification as a support for data visualization and decision making) exist but they are not directly applicable to any kind of dataset and their parameters are often too abstract and difficult to set up. As a result, this hinders the user ability to create efficient aggregated visualizations. To address these issues, we investigated a novel way of handling visual aggregation with a task-driven and user-centered approach. Given a graph, our approach produces a decluttered view as follows: first, the user investigates different edge bundling results and specifies areas, where certain edge bundling techniques would provide user-desired results. Second, our system then computes a smooth and structural preserving transition between these specified areas. Lastly, the user can further fine-tune the global visualization with a direct manipulation technique to remove the local ambiguity and to apply different visual deformations. In this paper, we provide details for our design rationale and implementation. Also, we show how our algorithm gives more suitable results compared to current edge bundling techniques, and in the end, we provide concrete instances of usages, where the algorithm combines various edge bundling results to support diverse data exploration and visualizations.},

Instead larger wholes separated from and related to one another are given in experience; their arrangement and division are concrete and definite. Do such arrangements and divisions follow definite principles? When the stimuli abcde appear together what are the principles according to which abc/de and not ab/cde is experienced? It is the purpose of this paper to examine this problem, and we shall therefore begin with cases of discontinuous stimulus constellations.

As one solution to this problem, this paper introduces a statistical model for fitting area-proportional Venn and Euler diagrams to observed data. The statistical model outlined in this paper includes a statistical loss function and a minimization procedure that enables formal estimation of the Venn/Euler area-proportional model for the first time. A significance test of the null hypothesis is computed for the solution. Residuals from the model are available for inspection. As a result, this algorithm can be used for both exploration and inference on real data sets. A Java program implementing this algorithm is available under the Mozilla Public License.

@article{Zhou2015,
abstract = {In many application domains, we encounter data which involves a graph encoding certain relationships and a set of items related to the graph. One example is in social websites where the users interact with each other, and share their interests on different items such as music or books. In this case, the direct interactions among the users can be represented as a graph, and the items like music or books can be represented as a set. People are often interested in the bipartite relation between the graph and the set. They might want to know the similarity or difference of the items liked by themselves and by their friends. In this paper, we propose a visualization framework designed for the micro-exploration and detailed analysis of relations involving a graph and a set. Our system consists of two major components: an enhanced graph view and a radial view. The enhanced graph view shows a social network of people and statistical information about the items which people are interested in, and the radial view is designed to show people's interests, the overlapping of their interests, and recommended items based on their interests. The combined use of the two visualization components can facilitate the discovery of various relational patterns underlying the links connecting the graph and the set. The experiment on the real dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of our technique.},
